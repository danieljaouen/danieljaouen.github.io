Mother Mary represents the Universal Church, as she is the Bride, and the Lord is the Bridegroom. If you think you come from a broken family, if you are baptized, think again! The Lord has adopted you into His Family. I pray that you get to know Him in all His Glory.</summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">GiveSendGo</title><link href="https://www.unite-the.church/blog/givesendgo" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="GiveSendGo"/><published>2024-11-17 20:00</published><updated>2024-11-17 20:00</updated><id>https://www.unite-the.church/blog/givesendgo</id><author><name>Daniel Jaouen</name></author><category term="site funds"/><summary type="html"> I just started a GiveSendGo to help me work on this site full-time.
