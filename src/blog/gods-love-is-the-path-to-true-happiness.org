One of the many difficulties of life is knowing in whom or what to place your
trust. Some of us place our trust in money, some of us in sex, some of us in
(temporary) power or social status. But all of these paths (if they were not
sent by God) ultimately lead to ruin. That is what Jesus meant when He said,
"The road to destruction is wide." These things can never satisfy because they
are all finite and exhaustible. The only thing that lasts Forever is God and
His Love for us on the Cross.

I urge you today, brothers and sisters, place your trust in the Lord, Jesus
Christ. His Love, if accepted, is the only thing that is inexhaustible and
lasts Forever. I pray that God grants you peace and blessings in your life
today.  Amen and amen!
