Here I stand, Lord, humbled before You.

As most of you know, I supported Kamala Harris for President of the United
States. However, it is clear that the Lord had a different Plan for the
country. I would like to take this time to thank the Lord for his Plan, as well
as say a short prayer for our new President.

Dear Lord,
Thank You for your perfect Plan for our country. While I supported the other
candidate, I am thankful the Presidency is in Your hands, and I submit to your
perfect Will. Please guide our new President in all ways, and help him to lead
this country to new heights of greatness for Your sake. Allow him to bring many
new converts and reverts back to the Christian and Catholic Faiths. I pray this
in Jesus' name. Amen!
