This is just a short reminder that, if you were baptized, Jesus Christ is your
Brother and the Blessed Mary is your Mother. Mother Mary represents the
Universal Church, as she is the Bride, and the Lord is the Bridegroom. If you
think you come from a broken family, if you are baptized, think again! The Lord
has adopted you into His Family. I pray that you get to know Him in all His
Glory.

Welcome to La Familia!
